<!-- DESCRIPTION -->
<h3 id="description"> :pencil2: Description</h3>
Tic Tac Toe is a two-player game in which the objective is to take turns and mark the correct spaces in a 3x3 (or larger) grid.

The player always starts the game. After the player's move, the computer randomly selects a place to move from the remaining free cells. 
There are 9 buttons (3 lengthwise and 3 widthwise), each of them is assigned a number (e.g. button1 from the top left is button1, then button2, button3...button9). 
When the game starts, after pressing any field, the '' ❌'' sign will appear and the background will change to pink and purple. 
You will immediately see the computer move ('' ⭕️'' on an orange background). After the movement of the computer is our movement again.
